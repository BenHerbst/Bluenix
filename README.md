# Bluenix - The Linux bluescreen



## Introducing
We already have things like activate Linux, Windows themes etc. on Linux to get a _good_ Windows like Linux experience...

But the most important thing is missing: **The bluescreen of death!**

This project tries to fill that gap and provide a bluescreen on Linux that you can show up on your system start.

Now everyone can finally use Linux without missing anything from Windows.

##  How to get it?
Download the latest version for Linux at: https://github.com/BenHerbst/Bluenix/releases/tag/stable

It is the .x86_64 file. Bluenix also runs under Windows ( the .exe ).

Then open your terminal of choice and enter the following:

```
cd ~/Downloads
chmod +x Bluenix.x86_64
./Bluenix.x86_64
```

You can now at the Bluenix.x86_64 file to your startup applications.
